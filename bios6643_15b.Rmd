# Case study I: weight loss trial

## Weight loss trial
- Randomized trial at the subject level to compare a toolboox intervention versus usual care in the primary care setting (reported in Saxon (2019 J Gen Intern Med))

- The toolbox consisted of: partial meal replacement program, Weight Watchers vouchers, recreation center membership, phentermine-topiramate ER, phentermine, or a group behavioral weight loss program (Colorado Weigh). 

  - After 6 months of participation in the study, participants add a second tool, or add 
  - A Diabetes Prevention Program-based weight loss maintenance program

- Study was conducted at 9 primary care clinics at Denver Health (DH)

- Participants were randomly selected from the DH registry 

##
- The primary outcome was percentage of participants who achieved 5% weight loss at 12 months in those offered the toolbox of weight loss options compared with the usual care group. 

- Secondary outcomes included weight loss tools chosen, weight loss tool utilization, and visit attendance.

- 305 individuals were randomly selected to be offered intervention, and 2640 were eligible comparators in the usual care group

- 119 individuals had a baseline visit (305-119=186 did not consent or did not attend baseline visit)

# Case study II: STEPPED Care trial
## Stepped care trial
STEPPED-CARE randomized trial. Results from real data included here.

- A behavioral intervention was tested versus usual care in 286 patients with lung or head and neck cancer.  
- Population: low income patients in the Denver area across 5 hospitals
- Primary outcomes: anxiety, depression and coping skills scores
- Outcomes were measured at baseline, and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks


## Demographic characteristics, death and lost to followup

```{r "fig.step1", echo=FALSE, out.width='110%'}

```{r "fig.step2", echo=FALSE, out.width='110%'}

```

## Longitudinal model results
```{r "fig.step3", echo=FALSE, out.width='110%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs_L15/fig-steppedt-3.png')
```

## Missing 
```{r "fig.step4", echo=FALSE, out.width='110%'}

```

# Case study III: Hormone therapy trial
## Hormone therapy trial to improve hot flushes/flashes

- Counts of the number of hot flushes per day over a period of one year, along with a daily severity level of the hot flushes, were recorded 

- 38 healthy women were randomized to medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) versus conjugated equine oestrogen (CEE, gold standard)
    - 20 women were in the MPA group and 18 in the CEE group

- The objective was to investigate if MPA reduced the number of hot flushes (and the their severity)

## Missing data might be NMAR
```{r "fig.horm1", echo=FALSE, out.width='110%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs_L15/fig-hormone-1.png')
```

## Joint model to address potentially informative visit process

- Joint model of 

  - counts of hot flashes daily - Poisson with random effects over time
  
  - visit process (whether information was non-missing on a given day) - logistic longitudinal model
  
  - results reported in Juarez-Colunga (2017 Biometrics)
  
  \medskip
  
- Look at the results in the counts submodel. This sensitivity analysis only tests for informative missing of the type considered.
