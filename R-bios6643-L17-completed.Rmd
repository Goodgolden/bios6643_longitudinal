## Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) study
- Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and eventually death

- 10-year study conducted by Mayo clinic (Murtagh et al., Hepatology, 1994) 

- 158 randomized to treatment, 154 to placebo

- Longitudinal biomarker measurements of serum bilirubin at times 0, 6m, 1y, 2y, etc.

\medskip
**Outcomes:**

  1. Longitudinal biomarker: serum bilirubin

  2. Time to death

**Question of interest:**

  - What is the association between the time-varying serum bilirubin (that is measured with error) and the risk of death?

```{r "pbc.data", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}
head(pbc2, 2)

```

## Joint model
```{r "jm", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}

lme.fit <- lme(log(serBilir) ~ year + year:drug, 
              data=pbc2, random = ~year|id)

surv.fit <- coxph(Surv(years, status2) ~ drug, 
              data=pbc2.id, x=TRUE)

## the knots of the piecewise constant are chosen based on the percentiles of events (5-6 internal knots by default)
joint.fit <- jointModel(lme.fit, surv.fit, 
              timeVar="year", method = "piecewise-PH-GH")
 
```

## Summary
```{r "jm.sum", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}
##summary(joint.fit)

plot(joint.fit)
```

## Confidence intervals
```{r "jm.ci", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}
confint(joint.fit, parm='all')

```

## Comparison of nested models
```{r "jm.lrt", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}
surv.fit2 <- coxph(Surv(years, status2) ~ 1, 
              data=pbc2.id, x=TRUE)

joint.fit2 <- jointModel(lme.fit, surv.fit2, 
              timeVar="year", method = "piecewise-PH-GH")

anova(joint.fit2, joint.fit)

```
There is no drug effect in the survival outcome (model fits about the same). 


# More practice with joint models
Use the data *aids* from the JM package. Take a look at *?aids* for a description of the dataset. 

A randomized clinical trial in which longitudinal and survival data was collected to compare the efficacy and safety of two antiretroviral drugs in treating patients who had failed/were intolerant of AZT therapy

- Longitudinal marker: CD4 cell counts
- Survival outcome: time to death
- Research goal: How is CD4 cell counts associated with a personâ€™s risk of death?
- Lower CD4 cell counts are associated with increased risk of death

```{r "aids.data", eval=T, echo = T, include=T, out.width="90%"}
head(aids, 2)

```

### Fit the joint model based on the fitted linear mixed and Cox models using the function jointModel()

Interpret the association between CD4 counts and the risk of death.
