\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Understand why we need special methods
\item
  Discuss example datasets that are longitudinal
\item
  Discuss time series vs.~longitudinal; formats for longitudinal data
\item
  Understand the assumptions for longitudinal models
\item
  Review analyses of longitudinal data with two time points

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What makes longitudinal data different, so that we need special
  methods?
\item
  What are clustered data?

  What are benefits of longitudinal models? (Or models for clustered

\begin{frame}{Longitudinal designs}
\protect\hypertarget{longitudinal-designs}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Designed experiments and observational studies can be applied to
  cross-sectional or longitudinal settings. Here, they are defined for
  the latter.
\item
  A controlled experiment involves an intervention, while an
  observational study does not.
\item
  In many cases a controlled experiment will have one or more true
  treatment groups, along with a `control' group that either receives
  some type of placebo, or does not receive any treatment.

\begin{block}{Time series methods (generally)\ldots{}}
\protect\hypertarget{time-series-methods-generally}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  focus on modeling one process over time (i.e., one observation taken
  at each time point, across time).
\item
  focus on predicting values of future occurrences.
\end{itemize}

Generally, time series data can be found everywhere, including: stock
prices, temperature, birth and mortality rates, health data for
individuals (e.g., blood pressure), just to name a few areas.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Longitudinal methods (generally)\ldots{}}
\protect\hypertarget{longitudinal-methods-generally}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Involve measurements on multiple subjects.
\item
  Assume that the correlation structure is the same across subjects but
  that responses are independent between subjects.
\end{itemize}

Often fewer time points for longitudinal data than time series data.

Although analytic methods for time series and longitudinal data differ,
they do have common elements, and the underlying processes that generate
the data are often similar. â€ƒ

\protect\hypertarget{stationary-processes}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A stationary process \(\{Y_t\}\) has a constant mean (expected value)
  and finite 2nd moment for all times \(t\), and the correlation between
  \(Y_t\) and \(Y_{t+h}\) does not depend on \(t\), for all \(h\).
\item
  Below, data for stationary processes were simulated for the model,
  \(Y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t\) where \(\mu\) is the mean and
  \(\epsilon_t\) are errors that are identically but not necessarily
  independently distributed.

  \(Z_t \stackrel {iid} \sim \mathcal {N} (0,\ 0.46)\), for all \(t\).
\item
  \textbf{Notes on AR(1) processes}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Errors \(\epsilon_t\) are identically distributed but not
    independent
  \item
    Must have \(|\phi| < 1\) for stationary process
  \item

  These data show that girls approach their maximum height much more
  quickly than boys. The y-axis scales were made the same for easier
  comparison between graphs.
\item
  Each curve is a percentile estimate as a function of age. We could
  create confidence bands for each percentile curve.
\item
  If the curves are estimated using a lot of data, the widths of the
  bands should be narrow. Doctors look for dramatic changes between
  visits.

\protect\hypertarget{what-weve-already-done}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Experiments with pre-post measurements have 2 measurements on each
  subject over time. When there are only 2 measurements, the analysis
  simplifies when the difference is considered, as the analysis is
  reduced to one measurement per subject. Simple methods can then be
  used (e.g., paired t-test).
\item
  Longitudinal models can still be beneficial here! But we'll discuss
  that later. For now, we consider simplified models.
\item
  Let's take a closer look at the underlying models when we use a
  difference score or take the baseline-as-covariate approach.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{usual-assumptions-for-longitudinal-models}{%
\section{Usual assumptions for longitudinal
models}\label{usual-assumptions-for-longitudinal-models}}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-9}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assumption 1: Responses between subjects are independent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If there are clear violations to the assumption, and data are
    available, then a random term could be added to deal with this
    non-independence.
  \item
    For example, if a class is used for the sample, and there are
    several pairs of siblings in the class, a random term identifying
    family could be added to the model. (Lack of fit and lack of
    independence are related!)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Assumption 2: There is a common covariance structure between all
  subjects, and the covariance parameters have the same value between
  subjects.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This assumption is usually not tested. However, to properly estimate
    covariance parameters, several subjects are needed (just as data for
    several subjects are needed to estimate a common population mean).
  \item
    In some cases, homogeneous groups within the study may be identified
    (but heterogeneous between groups). With sufficient group sample
    sizes, group-specific covariance parameters can be put in the model
    and estimated.

\begin{frame}{Longitudinal designs and power - an initial glimpse}
\protect\hypertarget{longitudinal-designs-and-power---an-initial-glimpse-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Consider an experiment designed to compare two treatments. Two common
  approaches:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A1: Use independent samples (randomly assign some subjects one
    treatment, and some the other). For A1, we often use a 2-independent
    sample t-test
  \item
    A2: Have all subjects have one treatment and then have them all take
    the other (e.g., use a crossover design to eliminate confounding
    effects related to time). For A2, a paired t-test.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A study/experiment involving changes within subjects (e.g., analyzed
  with a paired t-test) is often more powerful than a study using
  independent samples.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-10}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The general formula for the variance for the difference in means
  suggests why this may be expected (when correlations between responses
  within subjects are positive):
\end{itemize}

\[
Var[\bar Y_1 - \bar Y_2] = Var[\bar Y_1] + Var[\bar Y_2] - 2Cov[\bar Y_1,\ \bar Y_2]
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Often there are many factors not of interest that distinguish the two
  independent samples, while for the paired data, the difference in
  responses is due more to the treatment alone and not to other factors,
  since we're using the same subjects.
\item
  The same principle generalizing to multiple times and longitudinal
  data in general (e.g., air pollution study); subject serve as their
  own controls.
\item
  But paired/longitudinal designs may not always be better. In some
  cases a short cross-sectional study/experiment involving many subjects
  may be more feasible and cost-effective.
