# General guidelines for model building
## Why is it important to specify an appropriate covariance model?

  - Too restrictive specifications may invalidate inferences when assumptions do not hold
  
  - Overparameterization leads to inefficient estimation
  
  - Covariance structure itself may be of interest. However, it explains variability not explained by systematic trends so it depends on the mean structure

  - Appropriate covariance structure will also yield better predictions  

  
## General guidelines for model building

1. **Select a preliminary mean structure**. 
  - Consider flexible modeling of fixed effects
  
  - Look at smoothed trends over time

2. **Select a preliminary random effects structure ($G$)**

  - Plot OLS (ordinary least square) residual profiles versus time. This will provide an idea of the variance function over time. If constant, stationarity and random intercepts only might make sense
  
  - Consider a regression model for each residual profile 
  
  - Try to keep the hierarchy of polynomial random effects. For instance, if quadratic terms for random effects are included, then linear terms shoudl be included
  
  - Try to favor the inclusion of more random effects at this point 
  

## 


3. **Select a residual covariance structure ($R$)**

  - For balance data, explore the correlation between outcomes with different lag times
  
  - For highly imbalanced data, it is often assumed that random effects can account for most of the variation in the data and the remaining error component $\pmb \epsilon_i$ have a simple covariance structure 

4. **Consider model reduction** 

  - Assess which random effects are really needed in 2
  
  - Once a final covariance structure has been chosen, assess inclusion of fixed effects   

5. **Perform goodness of fit** 


# Nested versus crossed factors

## Definitions

- The term **\textcm{nesting}** can be applied to many things, including design structures, treatment structures, factors, data or models.  

- Factors A and B are **\textcm{crossed}** if every level of A appears with every level of B.  Such is the case for a 2-factor factorial treatment structure in a completely randomized design.  **Example**:  Myostatin experiment in notes.

-	Factors are **\textcm{nested}** when the levels of one factor occur with only one level of another factor.  
  - For example, consider a experiment designed to determine the effect of school and instructor on standardized test scores of kids in elementary schools, where each school has a \textcm{unique} set of teachers.

- Note that factors may be crossed even when units are nested.
  - For example, if you have Day (1, 2, 3, ...) and Time of Day (morning, noon, evening), then units for \textcm{Time} of Day appear to be \textcm{nested within Day}.

-	However, if 'morning', 'noon' and 'evening' have \textcm{consistent meanings} across days, then Day and Time of Day can be considered crossed factors.


## Examples:

### Crossed (e.g., Myostatin data)		

|         | Time1 | Time2 | Time3 |
|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Group A |   X   |   X   |   X   |
| Group B |   X   |   X   |   X   |

### Nested (e.g., standardized test data)

|          | Teacher1 | Teacher2 | Teacher3 | Teacher4 | Teacher5 | 
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| School A |    X     |    X     |          |          |          | 
| School B |          |          |    X     |    X     |          |  
| School C |          |          |          |          |    X     | 

# Nesting

## Notation for nesting:

-	On factors:  for B nested within A, you may see **\textcm{B (A)}** 
(e.g., SAS uses this).

- \textcm{On indices}: if $i$ and $j$ are indices for factors A and B, respectively, and B is nested within A, then an effect in the model may be denoted as \textcm{$\beta_{(j(i))}$}. 

- In SAS, when you specify \textcm{B(A)}, you are telling SAS that \textcm{B is nested within A}.  
  - Due to this, \textcm{levels of B are unique within A}; you have to consider the levels of B separate for each level of A, just like an interaction.  The code below shows equivalency of B(A) and $B \times A$.


## Nesting and interaction

- The data set below involves \textcm{measurements taken within days} (e.g., morning, noon, evening), for 3 different days. 
  - We would consider factors A and B \textcm{crossed} if the levels 'morning', 'noon' and 'evening' mean the same thing across days, and we would consider B \textcm{nested} within A if the levels of B could not be considered the same – e.g., if times of measurement varied across days.  The data and partial output follows.

```{r "sas1", echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs_L10/f1.png')
```

##

-	Estimates for specific \textcm{$time \times day$} combinations can be determined from the factor 'marginal' estimates (plus the intercept).  'Marginal'=main effect in this case.

```{r "sas2", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs_L10/f2.png')
```

- Using \textcm{$time \times day$} in place of time(day) will yield the same SAS output.   

## 

-	Determining whether factors are \textcm{crossed or nested should} not be based on model fit; rather, it should \textcm{be based on the design} of the experiment or study.  
  - But in some cases, there may be a fine line between whether factors are nested or crossed. 
 
-	In the example above, we said that factors are crossed if the \textcm{levels of time meant the same thing} across days.  The question is, how close in actual time do the measurements need to be to be considered 'the same'?



## Nested subjects

-	Before, we saw the use of the nested notation for \textcm{subjects within groups}.  

    - This relates to a \textcm{parallel experiment} in which subjects are randomly assigned to groups, and remain in those groups throughout the experiment.  

    - This differs from a crossover experiment.  (These will be discussed more in the next section.)

-	For a \textcm{parallel study/experiment, the use of ID(GROUP) is important} in SAS PROC MIXED if the same IDs are used in different groups (not a good practice, in general).  
  - When using PROC GLM for repeated measures ANOVA, the use of this nested variable is important whether or not the IDs are repeated.


## Nested versus crossed random effects

-	\textcm{Nesting and crossing apply to} random effects as well as \textcm{fixed effects}.  
  - Consider the standardized test data (see Course notes).  
  - If the given teachers and schools form a (random) sample from this population, then we can model school as one random effect term, and teacher within school [or \textcm{teacher(school)}] as another.  
  - The random statement in the PROC MIXED code would be:

		RANDOM school teacher(school);

-	For the psychological scoring data, the first approach was to model subject and rater as random effects.  Since \textcm{each rater scored each subject}, then the random effects were crossed:

		RANDOM subject rater;

#	Hierarchical Linear Models

##	Two-level models

-	A mixed model with subjects that are observed over time can be considered a hierarchical model, where the level 1 model consists of the responses over time for subjects ($Y_{ij}$), and the level 2 model consists of subject-specific random effect terms.  Specifically, considering the random intercept model, we have

	Level 1:  $Y_{ij}=\textcm{b_{0i}}+b_{1i} t_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$		
	
	Level 2:  $\textcm{b_{0i}=\beta_0+u_{0i}};\ b_{1i}=\beta_1$
	
- If we desire to have random slopes (for time) in the 2-level model as well as random intercepts, then we have

	Level 1:  $Y_{ij}=b_{0i}+\textcm{b_{1i}} t_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$		

	Level 2:  $b_{0i}=\beta_0+u_{0i}; \textcm{\ b_{1i}=\beta_1+u_{1i}}$

##
	
- Other types of 2-level models may not involve repeated measures.  

- E.g. health care costs for individuals with different health insurance providers at one time.

	- The \textcm{level 1} model would involve the subjects ($Y_{ij}$, $i$ denotes provider, $j$ denotes subject).

	- The \textcm{level 2} model would involve the providers.

	- Here, \textcm{subjects are nested within health-care providers}, and this could be modeled using a random intercept term for provider; subject variability will be accounted for with the residual error term.  The model could be expressed as:

	Level 1: $Y_{ij}=b_{0i}+\epsilon_{ij}$ (costs for individuals)
	
	Level 2:  \textcm{$b_{0i}=\beta_0+u_{0i}$} (random insurance provider effects)

##
	

- \textcm{Applying level terminology to the units}.  

  - For the standardized test data (teacher nested within schools), the level 1 units involve teachers and level 2 units involve schools.  
  
  - For the 3-level HLM with insurance data, the level 1 units involve the repeated measures over time, the level 2 units would be subjects, and level 3 units would be the providers.



## Three-level models

### Example 1: insurance provided data

For the insurance provider data, suppose that we have repeated cost measures for subjects over time.  A \textcm{3-level hierarchical model} could be developed for these data, where health care costs are denoted as $Y_{ijk}$, where $i$=provider, $j$=subject, $k$=time.

- The \textcm{level 1} model involves repeated measures within subjects, the \textcm{level 2} model involves the subjects themselves, and the \textcm{level 3} model involves the health care providers.

- This model may include two random intercept terms, one for provider, and one for subject within provider.

- The \textcm{lowest level (i.e., level 1)} of a hierarchical model involves the smallest unit of measurement while the \textcm{highest level} involves the largest unit of measurement.
	
##	
	
###	Example 2: Subjects that are obtained from different sites are monitored over time 

- There may be a treatment assignment to sites or subjects

-	This is often called a \textcm{multi-site study}, which is often performed because it is too difficult for one site alone to get all of the subjects for the experiment.

-	For example, the sites may be medical and research centers across the U.S.

-	Here, \textcm{leve1 1} involves the measures on subjects over time.  \textcm{Level 2} involves the subjects that are nested within sites, and \textcm{level 3} involves the sites.  (Of course, measures on subjects are nested within subjects!)

## 
###	Example 3: Children recruited from schools for a health study. 
 
-	Children are obtained by selecting them from classrooms within schools within the study area.

-	The \textcm{level 1} units involve the children's measurements; \textcm{the level 2} units are classrooms and the \textcm{level 3} units are the schools.

-	Note that children are nested within classrooms and classrooms are nested within schools.

-	We could extend this to \textcm{4-level} data if repeated measures were taken on the children, where the repeated measures within subjects would become the level 1 data.

# Case study

## Case study:  Kunsberg study

- An EPA-funded study at NJH has involved \textcm{kids} from the Kunsberg School (at NJH) that have moderate to severe asthma. 

- One of the \textcm{primary goals} has been to determine how the health of children is associated with air pollution on a day-to-day basis.  

- A number of \textcm{variables have been collected on subjects} (demographic, behavioral, and biological) as well as the environment (air pollution, meteorology) for this ongoing study.

\vspace{0.6cm}
- One of the difficulties with the data is that \textcm{siblings are often involved in the study}.  

  - For the 2001-02 school year, there were 48 subjects from 40 families; in 2002-03, there were 57 children from 52 families.  
  
  - In both years, there were never more than 2 kids involved from the same family.

##

- One of the key assumptions in our modeling is the \textcm{'independent subjects' assumption}.  

- In medical research, this assumption is many times ignored.  People often fret more about the normality assumption and ignore the independence assumption, the latter of which can be much more problematic.

- One of the reasons why the \textcm{independence assumption is violated} in medical research is because random sampling is sometimes unfeasible.  

  - Participants are often self selected.  
  - We can account for the possible dependency between siblings by including appropriate \textcm{random terms}.  
  - We can fit the model with and without the random terms to determine the impact of the dependency.

##

This can be considered \textcm{3-level data}, where

-	families are the level 3 unit

-	children within families are the level 2 unit

-	repeated measures within kids are the level 1 unit.

\vspace{0.6cm}

- For this analysis, \textcm{LTE4} (a specific biomarker in the body that has been shown to be associated with inflammation) was fit on the natural log scale as a function of date (linear time trend), cold (1=yes, 0=no – a time varying variable), temperature, pressure and humidity.  

- The \textcm{goal is to better understand how LTE4 relates to different variables over time}.  [Side note:  it has already been shown that LTE4 is related to air pollution.  See Rabinovitch, Strand, Gelfand, 2006 AJRCCM article.]


## The model

Let \textcm{$Y_{hij}$} denote LTE4 observation for $j$ time of $i$ subject within $h$ family (note that $h$ may be omitted since an observation is uniquely identified by subject and date).

$Y_{hij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 date_j+\beta_2 cold_{ij}+\beta_3 temp_j+\beta_4 pressure_j+\beta_5 humidity_j + \textcm{b_h+b_{(i(h))}} + \epsilon_{ij}$

\textcm{$b_h \sim \mathcal N(0,\ \sigma_F^2)$}

\textcm{$b_{i(h)} \sim \mathcal N(0,\ \sigma_S^2)$}

$\epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal N(0,\ \sigma_\epsilon^2)$


$\pmb \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal N(0,\ R_i)$, where \textcm{$R_i$ has the AR(1) form}.

## Synopsis and discussion

-	The \textcm{estimated variance for families and subjects within families} have roughly the same order of magnitude.  
    - By looking at the 2nd output, we can see that the ID(FAMILY) variance then absorbs all of the variance that was formerly attributed to the random family effect.

-	There is not a dramatic difference in fixed effect estimates for the 2 approaches.  

- The \textcm{AICs are comparable}, but a bit better without the family effect.  It is likely that the level of dependency due to siblings is not that great since there are few siblings involved.

-	Even though removal of the random term for family (and hence not accounting for the sibling effect) did not change estimates drastically, I would generally \textcm{warn against ignoring dependent data!}  It would be prudent to at least check for it.

-	If relevant, it is also possible to examine \textcm{nested effects for random slopes}.

-	For further details on hierarchical models fit to multi-level data (with an emphasis on the use of SAS PROC MIXED), see **Littell et al., SAS System for Mixed Models**.
